DESCRIPTION:
A random forest classifier (built with SKLearn) used to classify states in a presidential election. Data to train the model was taken form publicly available data from the US Census Bureau.
When a year is selected, the model will train on all other available data, and make a prediction. Predicted results and actual results will be displayed side by side on maps (not including
Alaska and Hawaii). More details on the specifics of implementation and data processing can be found in the report (DataMiningElectionReport.docx).
